This project effectively developed and implemented a recommendation system for mutual funds based on risk metrics, utilizing advanced techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and cosine similarity. The project involved comprehensive steps including data collection, preprocessing, and feature extraction, followed by the application of these methodologies to provide personalized fund recommendations.

 The models were rigorously tested and refined to ensure they provided reliable and relevant recommendations. Integrating this system into a financial advisory platform can significantly enhance decision-making for investors by offering personalized fund options that align with their risk tolerance and investment goals.

The successful execution of this project underscores the value of machine learning in financial advisory services, paving the way for more accurate and personalized investment recommendations. Going forward, the system will be continuously monitored and updated to adapt to market changes and evolving risk profiles, ensuring ongoing improvement in the quality and relevance of the recommendations.
